Continue implementing the AL-SHUAIL Mobile PWA project from where we left off.

  CURRENT STATUS:
  - Phase 1 (Security): COMPLETE - Role separation implemented
  - Dashboard: COMPLETE with exact demo design (DO NOT CHANGE)
  - Authentication: WORKING with phone/password
  - Deployment: LIVE at https://alshuail-admin.pages.dev/mobile

  NEXT TASKS (Phase 2 - Mobile Core UI):
  1. Enhance Profile page - Connect to real member data from Supabase
  2. Complete Notifications - Add database integration and real-time updates
  3. API Integration - Connect dashboard to live member/balance/payments APIs
  4. Hijri Calendar - Implement date conversion utilities

  IMPORTANT RULES:
  - DO NOT change the dashboard design - it matches client's exact requirements
  - Members can ONLY see their own data (security is critical)
  - Use Arabic as primary language with RTL support
  - Test accounts: 0555555555 / 123456
