# Al-Shuail Project: Lead Project Manager's Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Al-Shuail project, intended for project managers, team leads, and new developers.

## 1. Project Overview

The Al-Shuail project is a comprehensive web application with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend. It appears to be a management system, likely for a business or organization, with an administrative interface for managing members, activities, and expenses.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized into two main components:

*   **`alshuail-admin-arabic/`**: A modern frontend application providing the user interface for the administrative dashboard.
*   **`alshuail-backend/`**: A robust backend server that handles business logic, data processing, and API endpoints.

### 2.1. Frontend (`alshuail-admin-arabic`)

The frontend is a React-based application, likely bootstrapped with Create React App and customized with Craco. It includes:

*   **Modern JavaScript Tooling**: Utilizes Vite for development and builds, indicating a focus on performance.
*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The `src/components` directory suggests a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
*   **Styling**: Uses a combination of CSS, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.
*   **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: The presence of `PWA_IMPLEMENTATION.md` and service worker files suggests offline capabilities.

### 2.2. Backend (`alshuail-backend`)

The backend is a Node.js application, likely using the Express.js framework. Its key features include:

*   **RESTful API**: The `routes` and `controllers` directories indicate a well-structured API for managing resources like members, activities, and expenses.
*   **Database Integration**: The `config/database.js` and `setupDatabase.sql` files point to a relational database, likely PostgreSQL or MySQL.
*   **Authentication & Authorization**: The `middleware/auth.js` file suggests a secure authentication system.

## 3. Key Technologies

| Area      | Technology                               |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Frontend  | React, Vite, Craco, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS |
| Backend   | Node.js, Express.js                      |
| Database  | SQL (likely PostgreSQL or MySQL)         |
| CI/CD     | GitHub Actions                           |
| Other     | Docker, PWA                              |

## 4. Getting Started

To get the project up and running, you will need to:

1.  **Set up the database**: Use the scripts in `database-scripts/` to initialize the database schema.
2.  **Configure the backend**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `alshuail-backend/` and fill in the database credentials.
3.  **Install backend dependencies**: Run `npm install` in `alshuail-backend/`.
4.  **Start the backend**: Run `npm start` in `alshuail-backend/`.
5.  **Configure the frontend**: Copy `.env.production` to `.env` in `alshuail-admin-arabic/` and update the API endpoint.
6.  **Install frontend dependencies**: Run `npm install` in `alshuail-admin-arabic/`.
7.  **Start the frontend**: Run `npm start` in `alshuail-admin-arabic/`.

## 5. Deployment

The project is configured for continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions. The workflows in `.github/workflows/` automate the testing and deployment of both the frontend and backend.

*   **`backend-ci-cd.yml`**: Deploys the backend to a cloud provider.
*   **`frontend-ci-cd.yml`**: Deploys the frontend, possibly to a static hosting service like Cloudflare Pages.

## 6. Database

The `database-scripts/` directory contains essential SQL scripts for database management. These scripts are used for:

*   **Schema creation and updates**
*   **Data analysis and views**
*   **Testing and verification**

It is crucial to review these scripts before making any changes to the database schema.
