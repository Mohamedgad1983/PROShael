- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | ✅ PASS | Spec focuses on user needs without technical implementation |
| Requirements | ✅ PASS | 10 functional requirements, all testable |
| Success Criteria | ✅ PASS | 8 measurable outcomes, technology-agnostic |
| User Stories | ✅ PASS | 3 prioritized stories with acceptance scenarios |

| Assumptions | ✅ PASS | Clearly documented scope boundaries |

## Notes

- Specification is READY for `/speckit.plan` phase
